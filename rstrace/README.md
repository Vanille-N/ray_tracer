# RsTrace

### How to use this program

- Edit the `build_world` function in `src/main.rs`
- Execute `cargo run --release` (not using `--release` is useless since execution is a lot longer than compilation)
- Open the newly generated `img-*.ppm`

Information on available objects can be found in `../libtrace/DOC.md`.
