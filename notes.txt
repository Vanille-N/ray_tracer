*** Here is a sample of the kind of subtle bugs that sneaked into the code ***
These are non-breaking bugs that merely affect the appearance of objects.
It goes to show how difficult it is to track such flaws.

## The half-transparent metal
Due to a sign error in module hitable, in the reflect function, metals used
to be reflective from one direction, and transparent from the other. When only
spheres were used, it was invisible because only the outside was accessible
to rays.
Even when the ground was made an infinite plane the problem remained hidden
because by chance only one side of it was visible. The problem was made
apparent when a cube was constructed, as by chance three of its sides were
flipped. It took ~1h to identify the problem and add three mere lines of logic
to handle the two sides, one with a minus side.


## The super-reflective lambertian
This one is even more subtle.
I had forgotten to normalize the vector normal to a plane. This had no effect
on spheres and was invisible on the 1x1x1 Newton's Craddle, as the normal
vector happened to be a unit vector by chance. When The Craddle was expanded to
5x5x5, its upmost surface became even more reflective than metals.
Because the real reflected ray is chosen to point at random towards a point
within a unit sphere of the ideal calculated reflected ray's end, it completely
messed up reflection when a normal vector with huge length was introduced.
Indeed, Â±1 unit from the end of a 25-meter long vector is barely distinguishable
from no deviation at all.
