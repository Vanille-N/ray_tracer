# PyTrace

### How to use

```diff
- WARNING
PyTrace uses PyO3, and can thus only be built with the nightly Rust compiler.
```

- Run `cargo build --release`
- Copy `target/release/libpytrace.so` anywhere in your `$PATH` under the name `pytrace.so`. For example, any of the following could work, depending on your platform and environment:
    - `cp target/release/libpytrace.so usr/bin/pytrace.so`
    - `cp target/release/libpytrace.so pytrace.so` (only accessible from the current directory)
    - `mv target/release/libpytrace.so target/release/pytace.so ; export PATH=$(pwd)/target/release:$PATH`
- You can now `import` a ray tracer using `import pytrace as tr`

See `LIB.md` to see the autogenerated docs.
A few `.py` files provide working examples.
