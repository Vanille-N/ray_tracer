```diff
- WARNING
PyTrace uses PyO3.
If you wish to compile this crate, you should use Rust nightly.
```

### How to build

```shell
cargo build --release
cp target/release/libpytrace.so pytrace.so
```

That last step will only allow you to import the resulting library from your current directory. You may want to replace it with any of the following :
```shell
cp target/release/libpytrace.so usr/bin/pytrace.so
mv target/release/libpytrace.so target/release/pytrace.so; export PATH=$(pwd)/target/release:$PATH
...
```

You can now `import pytrace as tr` from any Python script, as long as `pytrace.so` is in your working directory or in your `PATH`.

The Github repository provides:
- `LIB.md` containing the autogenerated docs (available from a running Python instance with `help(pytrace)`)
- A few working examples in the form of executable `.py` files
- A sample of images and videos that were generated with the help of this library
