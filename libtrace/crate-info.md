# PyTrace (core)

Originally inspired by _Ray Tracing in One Weekend_ (Peter Shirley).

This crate is first meant to provide the basis for `pytrace`, but it can also be used from a Rust script.

See the Github repository for examples of how to use this crate or what kind of images can be generated.
